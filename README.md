1. Overview:
User authentication through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) module is a
robust and efficient method employed in various sectors such as access control,
attendance systems, and inventory management. This report explores the
fundamentals, implementation, advantages, and challenges associated with RFIDbased
user authentication systems.

This Arduino code integrates RFID-RC522 module, an LCD display, and Blynk IoT
platform to create an access control system

2. RFID Technology:
- Explanation of RFID components: RFID tags, readers, and antennas
- Working principle of RFID technology
- Types of RFID systems: active and passive RFID
3. User Authentication Process:
- Initialization phase: Registration of RFID tags and users
- Authentication phase: Matching RFID tag IDs with authorized users
- Access control mechanisms
4. Implementation:
- Hardware components required: RFID reader, tags, microcontroller
- Software architecture: Firmware for RFID reader, database management
- Integration with existing systems
